The Fabric port is currently incomplete and lacking in many features. Don't expect it to be finished
soon. If you want to contribute and help with the porting, then by all means go for it! However don't expect
to be able to play with this mod or have a compiled Jar anytime soon.

While you wait for the port, you can listen to [Tchaikovsky's violin concerto in D major](https://youtu.be/cbJZeNlrYKg).
<sup>Seriously, it's an awesome piece of music</sup>

Welcome to Create, a mod offering a variety of tools and blocks for Building, Decoration and Aesthetic Automation.

The added elements of tech are designed to leave as many design choices to the player as possible, where item processing doesn't happen inside a single block with funny textures, it requires a set of actors working together in many possible arrangements.

Check out the wiki and in-game Tool-tips for further info on how to use these features, and stay tuned for an ever-growing selection of possibilities for Creative and Survival Minecraft.
